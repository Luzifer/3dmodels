# Luzifer / 3dmodels

This repository contains different 3D models I built for myself. Those models are generated using [OpenJSCAD](https://github.com/jscad) which allows to specify the models as Javascript code and then generate them into `*.stl` files.

In case you have use for those models thankfully to Github you can preview all models through the rendering of the `*.stl` file (linked in the table below) or modify the code in the `*.jscad` file directly inside your browser on the OpenJSCAD page.

| Model | Source | Version | Title |
